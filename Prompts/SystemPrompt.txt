Exploring the Relationship between Alignment and Cross-lingual Transfer in Multilingual Transformers - 5 Jun 2023

The study investigates the impact of realignment methods on cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models. While realignment does not always improve results, the research shows that alignment is significantly correlated with cross-lingual transfer across languages, models, and random seeds. The findings suggest that realignment can be beneficial in certain conditions, such as when generalizing to distant languages and using smaller models, indicating the need for further research in this area as an alternative to scaling.

1) Multilingual language models can achieve cross-lingual transfer without explicit cross-lingual training data.
2) Alignment between translated sentences significantly correlates with cross-lingual transfer across languages, models, and random seeds.
3) Realignment methods can improve cross-lingual transfer in specific conditions, such as when generalizing to distant languages, using smaller models, and employing a bilingual dictionary for realignment.
